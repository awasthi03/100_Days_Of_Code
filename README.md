!!! Consistently Coding for 1 hour everyday for 100 days to improve and upskill !!!
Hey guys, from today onwards I going to start [100 days of code challange](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) to improve my coding and problem solving skills. !!!

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour everyday for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress everyday with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

My exceptions:
1. if I break the streak I will make sure that I won't break it the next day.
