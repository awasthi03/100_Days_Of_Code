# 100_Days_Of_Code
!!! Consistently Coding for 1 hour everyday for 100 days to improve and upskill !!!

Hey guys, from today onwards I am starting 100 days of code challange to improve my coding and problem solving skills. 
I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:

1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag
My Exceptions:

-> If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
-> My Community work, and few emergencies demands to take a day off
